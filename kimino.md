# ABSTRACT

We overhauled Kimino's digital profile by redesigning their website and introducing Klaviyo email marketing to their customer base. We used data collected with tools ranging from Google Analytics to General Instance to craft a unique user experience centered around maximizing e-commerce revenues while remaining faithful to Kimino's elegant identity and emphasis of traiditional Japanese farming methods.

# WEB DESIGN, E-COMM OPTIMIZATION

Sam served as lead designer and developer of Kiminoâ€™s new US and Japanese site designs with George's creative direction. We used the new Shikoku assets in the new iterations of the website, included marked improvements to accessibility, purchase interface and flows and a cleaner and simplified overall UI.
