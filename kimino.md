# ABSTRACT

After a comprehensive site audit, we overhauled Kimino’s e-commerce with a web redesign and the introduction of Klaviyo email marketing. We used data collected with tools ranging from General Instance to Google Analytics to craft a unique user experience centered around maximizing e-commerce revenues while remaining faithful to Kimino’s elegant identity and emphasis of traditional Japanese farming methods.

Working remotely with photo and videography teams on Kimino’s partner farms in Shikoku, we produced content for social and email campaigns. The shoots centered around the daily routines of Yuzu farmers and their relationship to the practice, many of whom inherited the practice from their parents.
