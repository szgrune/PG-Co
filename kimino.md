# ABSTRACT

After a comprehensive site audit, we overhauled Kimino’s e-commerce with a web redesign and the introduction of Klaviyo email marketing. We used data collected with tools ranging from General Instance to Google Analytics to craft a unique user experience centered around maximizing e-commerce revenues while remaining faithful to Kimino’s elegant identity and emphasis of traditional Japanese farming methods.

# WEB DESIGN, E-COMM OPTIMIZATION

Sam served as lead designer and developer of Kimino’s new US and Japanese site designs with George's creative direction. We used the new Shikoku assets in the new iterations of the website, included marked improvements to accessibility, purchase interface and flows and a cleaner and simplified overall UI.
