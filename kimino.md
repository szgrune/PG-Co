# APPROACH

Using tools ranging from Google Analytics to GA Instance and our own qualitative findings based on our training in e-commerce best practices, we sought to create an enhanced user experience of Kimino online by enhancing content, communication and technology.

        George, acting as Kimino’s Art Director/Creative lead, produced content for social and email campaigns with photo and videography teams working on Kimino’s partner farms in Shikoku. Scenes included the Japanese pastoral landscape, focusing especially on Yuzu farmers.

# WEB DESIGN, E-COMM OPTIMIZATION

Sam served as lead designer and developer of Kimino’s new US and Japanese site designs with George's creative direction. We used the new Shikoku assets in the new iterations of the website, included marked improvements to accessibility, purchase interface and flows and a cleaner and simplified overall UI.
